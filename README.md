# The Link Between Social Media Posts and Asset Recall in Sports Sponsorship

## **Executive Summary**

The relationship between paid and earned social media posts in which a brand appears and
fans’ recall of the brand in the posts is statistically and practically significant. Accounting for
sponsor category, contract length, and title partner status, increasing social posts by 10% is associated with a 1.52% increase in recall of the sponsor’s social media posts. For example, a
business manager who increases sponsorship social media posts from 5 to 25 per season could
expect recall of their social media to rise by approximately 28%.
